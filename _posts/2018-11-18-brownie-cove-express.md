contribution:
- Brownie Cove Express is a haunted collage adventure game about trains, snow, ghosts,
  and memories. It will depart in winter.
- Across windy mountain trails and tracks, snowy static blizzards, and other such
  cold wintery magics, a train powers on - carrying a group of mysterious travellers
  to an unknown fate - you explore their stories through experimental narrative and
  playful vignettes.
- 'Much of the game is spent reading and interacting with the 6 complex and intriguing
  characters through choices. Rather than focusing on large branching stories where
  players can control the outcome, the story is more linear with a focus on experimental
  prose, with the choices reflecting player expression and curiosity. '

  quote: This is definitely a game with a lot to say and a lot to think about; it's
    experimental for a reason, so certainly not for everyone, but players that can
    appreciate something deep, artful, and unique will appreciate Brownie Cove Express.

  quote: I have never been taken to such emotional depths so quickly as I have been
    with Brownie Cove Express. It’s a nearly-painful look at what exists within ourselves,
    forcing me to face some things I’d long buried.
