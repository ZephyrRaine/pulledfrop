  quote: This is definitely a game with a lot to say and a lot to think about; it's
    experimental for a reason, so certainly not for everyone, but players that can
    appreciate something deep, artful, and unique will appreciate Brownie Cove Express.

  quote: I have never been taken to such emotional depths so quickly as I have been
    with Brownie Cove Express. It’s a nearly-painful look at what exists within ourselves,
    forcing me to face some things I’d long buried.

  quote: The artwork is excellent and the trailer and official website help to create
    a surreal and unsettling tone. Who knows what mysteries Brownie Cove Express will
    hold, but it certainly looks like it’s going to be an interesting ride.
