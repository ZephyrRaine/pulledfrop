catchphrase: infinite driving talking
context_description: Artistic project
stack: Unity
contribution:
- Sam drove for four hours while talking the whole time.
- He then retranscribed everything he said in text form.
- I took this input and put it in a Unity project that reads the text infinitely based
  on the time of day, showing the same part of the text for everyone.
