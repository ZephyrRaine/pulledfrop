- "It is a time of war.  \nThe RESISTANCE is dwindling, and the last remaining members
  take refuge in an abandoned power station in the heart of the EXHAUSTLANDS.  \nThe
  FASCIST army moves closer everyday - unstoppable and hungry.  \nUnder the cold BROWNIE
  COVE sun, members of the resistance journey out into the lands to explore the area,
  and prepare to do battle with the approaching DARKNESS."
