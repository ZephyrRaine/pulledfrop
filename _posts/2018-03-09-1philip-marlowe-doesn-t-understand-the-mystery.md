- It's been a long night, and it's only going to get longer. Philip Marlowe doesn't
  understand the mystery.
- A short abstract neo-noir experience about confusion, memory, driving, mysteries,
  cats, and raymond chandler's classic the long goodbye.

- quote: Taking you to another slightly strange narrative, Philip Marlowe Doesn’t
    Understand The Mystery shows you a window into the life of a detective that just
    isn’t understanding their case. The clues, the information they have, none of
    it adds up.

  quote: Most detective or crime based games focus on the cases, not on the characters.
    The players have to crack the mysterious murder, they have to find out who is
    a criminal, they achieve something in the end. But what happens if you take that
    achievement away and then confront your players with a struggling detective, whose
    mind and memory seem to be uncontrollable?
