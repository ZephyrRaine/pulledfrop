- You can't remember what time it is, but you know it is late. you have just checked
  into your room at the Brownie Cove Hotel. the bed is lumpy and you can't sleep,
  but the tv is tempting...
- Almost a year after its release, we made a physical version of the game to be showcased
  in the Leftfield Collection at EGX 2018.

    entirely. I am drawn to see all of the shows and understand what is behind each
    one…

  quote: We saw many games at EGX 2018 but none were presented with such a unique
    style that Between Stations came with.

  quote: The deliberately mundane vessel of old, late-night hotel television is elevated
    by parodical wit and the elements of novelty and surprise.

  quote: Between Stations catches this scenario perfectly and is also such an amazing
    narrative experience, that I really hope that you will play it.

  quote: Guilt, awkwardness, humour, unease and confusion are delivered in rapid succession
    by this game, presented purely through simple multiple choice decision making.

  quote: EGX’s Leftfield Collection is famous for always having at least one game
    with a strange custom hand built controller. Actually this year there’s more than
    one, but Between Stations stands out.

  quote: Se basant sur divers témoignages retrouvées sur des tablettes anciennes,
    Between Stations se veut une reconstitution fidèle de cette télévision, de cette
    « télé » comme disaient les anciens, de cette époque où il neigeait tous les jours
    entre les stations.
