- You can't remember what time it is, but you know it is late. you have just checked
  into your room at the Brownie Cove Hotel. the bed is lumpy and you can't sleep,
  but the tv is tempting...
- Almost a year after its release, we made a physical version of the game to be showcased
  in the Leftfield Collection at EGX 2018.

  quote: The deliberately mundane vessel of old, late-night hotel television is elevated
    by parodical wit and the elements of novelty and surprise.

  quote: Guilt, awkwardness, humour, unease and confusion are delivered in rapid succession
    by this game, presented purely through simple multiple choice decision making.

- title: Trusted Reviews
  quote: EGX’s Leftfield Collection is famous for always having at least one game
    with a strange custom hand built controller. Actually this year there’s more than
    one, but Between Stations stands out.
